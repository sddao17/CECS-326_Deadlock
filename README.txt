* Purpose: To solve the problem of deadlock by simulating villagers from two separate types of villages, who all want to use a shared road which only allows one villagers to use it at any single point in time.

* Supported by Java-based applications.

* JDK version 9.0+ recommended.

* No installations required.

Compile / Run Instructions
-----------------------------------------------


------------------------
For Java-supported IDEs:
------------------------


* Load the source folder containing the `Main.java`, `EastVillager.java`, and `WestVillager.java` files into the IDE of your choice.

* (Optional) Customize the number of villagers / thread-sleeping intervals by editing the global variables found in `Main.java` file.

* Compile and then run the `Main.java` file. You should see the different villagers switching their use the road one at a time.


--------------------------------
For Command Prompts / Terminals:
--------------------------------


* On the command prompt / terminal, change the current directory to the path of the source folder containing the files `Main.java`, `EastVillager.java`, and `WestVillager.java`. You can do this with the command `cd <insert path here>`. The path should end with a pattern similar to the following : `...\src`.

* Compile the `Main.java` file with the command: `javac Main.java`.

* Run the `Main.java` file with the command: `java Main.java`. You should see the different villagers switching their use the road one at a time.
